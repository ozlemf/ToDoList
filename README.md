Hello,

I have developed a simple To-Do List application written in C#. 
I have used Access as the database. Inside the folders, you will find a sample database.
After creating a folder named "ToDo" in your C drive, please place the database file inside it (â€ªC:\ToDo\bsk.mdb). 
You can modify the path within the code if needed.
